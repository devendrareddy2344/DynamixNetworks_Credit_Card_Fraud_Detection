## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection system** using **Machine Learning** and deploys it as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The model is trained on a **highly imbalanced transactional dataset** and is designed to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false negatives.  
After evaluating multiple algorithms, the **Extra Trees Classifier** was selected due to its strong performance on tabular data and robustness against imbalance.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately  
- Handle highly imbalanced datasets effectively  
- Build a reliable and interpretable ML model  
- Deploy the trained model as a web application  
- Enable real-time fraud prediction for new transactions  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### ✔ Data Challenges
- Severe class imbalance (fraud cases are extremely rare)
- High-dimensional numerical features
- High cost of false negatives (missed frauds)

### ✔ Techniques Used
- **StandardScaler** for feature normalization  
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance training data  
- **Extra Trees Classifier** for robust ensemble-based classification  
- Model evaluation using:
  - Recall (Primary Metric)
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix

## ⚙️ Model Training Workflow

1. Load the dataset  
2. Separate features and target variable  
3. Perform stratified train-test split  
4. Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler  
5. Balance training data using SMOTE  
6. Train Extra Trees Classifier  
7. Evaluate model using classification metrics  
8. Save trained model and scaler

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- **Recall (Primary Focus)**  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Confusion Matrix  

> **Recall is prioritized** because missing a fraudulent transaction is more costly than incorrectly flagging a genuine one.
