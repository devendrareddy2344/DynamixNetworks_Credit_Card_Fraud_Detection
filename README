💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – ML & Streamlit Application
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning.
The model is trained on imbalanced transactional data and deployed using Streamlit to provide real-time fraud prediction.

The system uses an Extra Trees Classifier, which performed best compared to other models due to its ability to handle complex patterns and imbalanced data effectively.

🎯 Objectives

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately

Handle highly imbalanced datasets

Build a reliable and interpretable ML model

Deploy the trained model as an interactive web application

Enable real-time prediction for new transactions

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
✔ Data Challenges

Severe class imbalance (fraud cases are very rare)

High dimensional numerical features

Need for strong recall on fraud class

✔ Techniques Used

StandardScaler for feature scaling

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance data

Extra Trees Classifier for robust classification

Proper evaluation using Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall (Primary Focus)

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix

Recall is prioritized since missing a fraud transaction is more costly than false positives.
